# Apple-II-Emulator

The purpose of this emulator is to provide an opportunity to use old technology and experience what
it was like to use a computer from 1977. Despite the fact that little abstraction is given from the
core functionality of the computer and the user/programmer, the goal is for anyone to understand how
to use the emulator after a bit of reading.

Usage instructions are in the wiki.

### Due to the libraries and APIs used, this emulator only works with Windows.
